"""Tests for how ScyllaCluster operations reach the cluster's loop.

The cluster runs on its own event loop and owns state that belongs to it: the
Scylla subprocess transports and the per-server asyncio locks.  Its operations
therefore have to run on that loop, whichever loop -- or thread -- the caller
happens to be on.  The cluster_op decorator is what guarantees that.

The exercise here uses a real ScyllaCluster with a stub server stop, so the
decorator and the bridge under test are the production ones.

    ScyllaServer.stop() awaits its subprocess transport, and that transport
